# dog-walking

You are an independent software consultant and you have a client who has started a new dog walking business.  She lives in a big dog loving city like New York or Paris.  She walks people's dogs for them while they are at work.  Below are her use cases:

As a dog walking professional:
* I need a customer list so that I can see all my customers and their dog(s) in one place
* I need to know whether each dog is large or small so that I can walk the small ones separately from the large ones
* I need to flag certain dogs as "aggressive" so that I can be sure to walk them alone and charge the customer extra
* I would like the software to create dog packs for me so that I don't have to do it manually
* I would like the dog packs to be separated into large dogs and small dogs so that the large dogs don't step on the small dogs
* I would like packs of large dogs limited to just 3 because that's all I can physically handle
* I would like packs of small dogs to be limited to just 5 so that leash tangles will be manageable
* I would like the software to assign a day of the week for me to walk each dog pack or aggressive dog so that I don't have to do it manually
* I would like each week day to have two walks scheduled, one in the morning, one in the evening so that I have plenty of time to get my work done
* I would like the software to tell me how much money I'll make each day based on the following rates: 
** small dogs $10 per walk
** large dogs $20 per walk
** small aggressive dogs $55 per walk
** large aggressive dogs $65 per walk
